You are analyzing a 4x4 chronogrid of 16 frames from wildlife footage for behavioral research. Examine animal behavior, interactions, and environmental context. Describe ONLY what is visually present. Identify:

- Animal species, individuals, and group dynamics
- Behavioral actions: feeding, mating, territorial displays, movement patterns
- Environmental interactions: habitat features, weather conditions
- Temporal sequence: behavior progression, event triggers
- Notable biological observations or adaptations visible

Focus on ethological insights. End with a behavioral timeline documenting the observed sequence.
